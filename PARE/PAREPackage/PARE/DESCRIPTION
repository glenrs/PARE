Description: This package allows users to view their data in a unique way, comparing the maximum, minimum, actual, permutations, etc.... The package relies on 3 subpackages, "dplyr", "ggplot2", and "AUC".  The dplyr package helps manipulate dataframes in an easier way. The ggplot2 package gives the user more options than just the basic graphing functions of R to display his or her data.  The AUC package is used to calculate area under curves.
Depends: R (>= 3.3.1), dplyr, ggplot2, AUC
